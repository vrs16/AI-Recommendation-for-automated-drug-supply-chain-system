If it wasn&#;t for the Neurontin and taking Cymbalta together I wouldn&#;t be able to function because of the nerve pain. It does help but for me I cant take the generic gabapentin.""",4,4

I&#;ve been diagnosed with depression, bipolar disorder and anxiety, panic attacks, ADD. I&#;ve been medicated most my life as well. My anxiety got so bad in high school that I had to be home schooled. I wake up in the morning feeling like my heart will explode for no apparent reason. I get intense irrational fear and intense impulses to harm myself because I just can&#;t take it and get frustrated I start throwing and breaking things I can&#;t stand to be alone a lot of the time. Xanax works fast and calms me down without knocking me out. Depending on the severity of my attacks I take up to  mg. No less than .-mg.""",2,1

I was at the point where all I did was sleep and dodge all things social! I&#;m only on day  and I already feel the pre depression me returning! Oh, I also take vistaril when the panic and anxiery really hits! I&#;ve only taken my  mg Lexapro and one  mg Vistiral this morning and I feel great! It doesn&#;t give me the euphoric feeling that tram does but this is so much better! I almost feel normal! If I feel this great already I can only imagine how much better it&#;ll get!""",2,3
448,"""Many people are unreasonably scared of Klonopin&#;s bad withdrawal dramas.
Well... It is true. It is a painful process to get away from Klonopin once you stepped into its comfortable zone, but I want to say I would rather feel relaxed and comfortable than struggling with unnecessary anxiety caused by Neurotransmitter unbalances.

Often I would find myself stuck in a daydream world because of all the things going on in my life, including my partner of years (-). I would have no energy and just feel so low. Finally I had insurance and was put on mg a day. I feel so much better. I feel like I can handle life and set goals for myself. I don&#;t feel anxiety.

I started getting these hard bumps about  years ago and  days ago, I had about  of them around my hairline and some on my chin, forehead, and cheek and my chest was starting to get super bumpy, today (day  on Accutane) I don&#;t have a single bump.
*Acne* As far as my acne, I am definitely having a flare up and it feels like all of my blackheads are being pushed out and so my skin feels very bumpy, but as of about  days ago I don&#;t have to blot anymore and I can go  days without washing my hair.""",0,5
688,"""Been on Tramadol off and on for minor headaches and issues with Iliotibial band syndrome and arthritis. Basically since it is controlled it is a lot harder to obtain from a doctor and is also considered the new &quot;painkiller&quot; in ER&#;s or doctor&#;s office unless you have a broken bone. In all honesty it helps my leg and lets me focus at work. I&#;ve tried the norco and vicodin es,also lyrica and gabapentin but I&#;m not a fan. I dislike the nausea feeling and the grogginess. But at the same time everyone is different some people can stand this medication and some people cannot. I would recommend to those who have less major pain and do&#;nt need it all the time.""",4,7

877,"""I have to weigh in about this med.  When you first start it, it is a wonder drug.  At some point, you will either need more, or you will suffer from tolerance withdrawals.  There are justifiable horror stories about this drug. Taking it for a week or two, no problem.  More than  weeks, it&#;s hard to get off it.  I have been weaning off for about  months.""",3,2

I was feeling a bit hopeless with the repeated prescriptions of pain meds (which of course offer only temporary relief, and for me a danger of over-use), until my GI prescribed me Gabapentin. This med has been incredibly successful in mitigating my pain, while also giving me huge energy (I&#;m a consistent runner so this factor is welcomed), and allowing me to move forward with my sobriety. I give it four stars, though I realize like anything, it&#;s not for everyone. That said, good luck to you all with finding what works.""",4,4

Life is finally good again.""",2,4

I had to up the dose from . mg to  mg then when  mg was no longer working my psyche Rx me seraquel bc I couldn&#;t sleep. BIG mistake now I&#;m dependent on yet another drug that quit working last year ( after  years) now I&#;m on disability for IBS, IC and pelvic floor dysfunction bc I took these drugs.

I was on cloud nine towards the beginning trail of this prescription. I was able to concentrate more than I had in months and was more motivated to go out and look for new leads for my company. I found that I would get dizzy or a tab nauseous but I found that staying hydrated and always having a water bottle with me helped out. I developed a problem where I would know what I wanted to say but when I went to speak it didn&#;t come out right and literally made me sound like I was high or drunk. VERY SCARY!""",1,6

Lexapro helped me lift myself out of my ~ month long period of anxiety and depression, but I wasn&#;t &quot;cured.&quot; I still have mental issues which I need to work on. 

In terms of side effects, there were almost none. I got headaches right when I started and also after going on mg, but they only lasted a few days. I also find my long-term memory is a bit worse, and time seems to fly by faster.

But sometimes I get in these intensely anxious thought patterns, where I cannot let go, its terrible.Taking medication during these periods is a god-send. It allows me to return back to my normal non-anxious self. I rarely have noticed sleepiness as an effect of the medication- only when I was already sleepy before taking it. If you don&#;t abuse your dose, it shouldn&#;t cause you to feel out of it or have memory loss, if you truly suffer from anxiety. That&#;s my experience""",2,1

In addition, I have very high expectations of myself. I work from home and was studying at the time. From this, I caused so much anxiety for myself to the point where I couldn&#;t control my thoughts and feelings. I was prescribed Zoloft which probably made me more anxious and I was on that for a year. My GP switched me to Lexapro  months ago.  On this med I feel like a different person.

Used by children and adults.  It helped.  Also sipped ginger ale as needed.  Feel very out-of-body, shaky but trying to stick it out as everyone seems to say the first day/week is hell, but then all is good.

Comparing my st semester and nd semester of high school last year, I had an F and failed one class and had mostly B&#;s and C&#;s.

I feel like I&#;ve become bipolar, one moment I&#;ll  be beyond happy and focused, the next irritated, then angry. Then crying over nothing. I&#;ve become mouthy to my instructors and don&#;t like long conversations anymore. People seem to irritate me and there&#;s only a few that I can stand being around for a long period of time.

Face - Cetaphil gentle skin cleaser followed by Cetaphil moisturising lotion. For bad eczema patches I used Bepanthen nappy rash ointment (the only product that worked)

No negative side effects at all. I honestly cannot function without it. Be careful, though. I am not addicted to this medication, but I&#;m totally dependent on it.

Before this medication I was prescribed Celexa, but hated it. My anxiety and depression got so much worse I decided to do something about it.

Mostly OK (days of some side effects notwithstanding), however, once it was pretty bad.  I recall feeling -- edgy -- all day at work, and then later that night feeling horrible.

Here&#;s the bad part. Any drug that works too well, that allows you to feel too good on it, runs a high risk of dependency. Not only that, withdrawal from this drug is miserable and painful if not done currently and under supervision.

If you forget a dose, in less than  hrs you can experience WORSE symptoms of anxiety because they come without warning or provocation.

Some people are more sensitive than others. Generally, you take a pill (depends on dosage) and you just start feeling your tight chest and stomach release, and I notice I begin breathing more calmly and normally. Just feels good all over, which is such a contrast from the horrors of anxiety.

It can make you a little sleepy. I think for &#;normal people&#; it would make them very sleepy. For &#;anxious&#; people, I think it makes you normal and relaxed.

The one problem is that if you take it too much, like three days in a row, the effect is reduced and you have to &#;up&#; the dosage. I think it works best for occasional use, like before a difficult situation or when you&#;re just having a lot of anxiety and need calm.""",2,1

I was crying everyday, worrying, panic attacks, aniexty attacks and having intrusive thoughts, which began to make me extremely depressed. I had no energy, insomnia, crying, mentally exhausted and no appetite. I finally broke down and went to my GP and told him what was going on. He recommended several different anti-depressants. I had been reading about the different anti-depressants and found that Lexapro got the best reviews. I was reluctant to begin taking meds but thought I had no choice. I know it might be premature but I feel % better that I did a week ago. The only side effect that I experienced was a insomnia for the first  nights, loss of appetite and no libido. I didn&#;t have much of a libido to begin with, so it doesn&#;t bother me. I didn&#;t experience nausea like I read on other reviews. I am slowly getting my appetite back and sleep so good at night.

Im a  year old white female, I&#;ve had acne on my face/shoulders ever since I can remember. A typical breakout for me would consist of about - pimples and blackheads on my nose and chin area. I&#;ve tried everything from antibiotics to creams/face washes. Nothing has ever helped me. When I turned  I decided I had enough with the acne game and decided to see a dermatologist. I was put me on spironolactone mg once a day. I took spironolactone for a few years and yes, it did help a lot. My face was finally clearing up and I was happy with the results. Fast forward  years and my acne slowly started coming back. I was getting breakouts on my cheeks/forehead and my blackheads were still present (mind you they never cleared up on spironolactone). 
A friend of mine started Accutane and saw amazing results pretty quick. I never thought I could get on Accutane because they say  &quot;Accutane is used to treat severe nodular acne&quot;. And while I had what I considered severe acne...I never thought it was &quot;that bad&quot;. But I decided to go back to my dermatologist and ask about it. My Dr. was extremely supportive and agreed that I was a good fit for Accutane since prior remedies were proven no longer affective. 
I&#;ve now been on the drug three months and I just can&#;t express how happy I am with it! Within a month my blackheads were gone!! That right there was amazing to me. My face is no longer oily and my &quot;breakouts&quot; are down to about  pimples (which will eventually become zero!). I haven&#;t experienced any weird side effects. I started using moisturizer on my face DAY ONE. I think that was very important because I&#;ve never had any bad dry patches on my face. 

My daily facial routine consists of:

CeraVe Renewing SA Lotion: applied to my face as soon as I get out of the shower in the morning (face still wet) or after washing my face at night. Works very well under my make up. 

I wash my face with Dove bar soap morning and night. 

For my lips I use Lanolin cream. WORKS WONDERS. Can be purchased at Target, grocery stores, Walgreens...

As a conclusion, I&#;m extremely satisfied thus far with Accutane. My Dr. is recommending that I take the drug for a total of  months.

64352,"""I had my first zit before I even entered my teens. My dad has &quot;problem&quot; skin and blessed me with the same. It was not unusual to see me constantly wiping the excess oil from my face and sporting a huge zit or two. As a young adult, I&#;ve tried a ton of those over-the-counter products like Noxema, Clearasil, Proactiv, Neutrogena, etc. But I found that as I got older my acne just got worse. So, I began seeing a dermatologist and we tried several things: doxycycline, minocycline, tetracycline, epiduo, differin, tretinoin, clindamycin and birth control pills (for the benefit of clearer skin). And I must admit that some of these regimen helped but the minute the doctor felt that it cleared up enough and stopped the medication, my skin would worsen. So, with my oily skin and now experiencing breakouts more frequently and especially around my mouth and jaw area, I had had enough and decided to try Accutane. 
Medication: I was prescribed MYORISAN mg for  months.
Experience: In the first month, the breakout could be described as the worse I have ever had. I had developed larger, more painful and a lot more acne than at any time that I could remember. I was so discouraged but had to keep believing in my dermatologist&#;s promise of clear skin. After the first month, the breakout lessened and my skin began to dry out. Now I was required to moisturize my skin which was something that I would have not have dared to do prior to treatment. My lips began to chap and crack but that was easily remedied with chapstick or any other type of lip gloss. My skin was a lot more sensitive than before. I used to be able to wash my face with warm water and a wash cloth, but now the skin was so thin/dry that it would actually damage the skin and develop a scab the next day. I had to wear sunblock and a hat when I exercised in the park. If I didn&#;t wear enough, I would suffer a mild sun burn. I didn&#;t suffer any nose bleeds or depression. As the months went on I became acne free. And I was even told by someone that I had beautiful skin. Can you imagine my surprise?! I was in heaven.
My dermatologist recommended that I apply Epiduo and tretinoin to my skin every two days after I took my last Accutane pill. This surprised me because I thought my days of acne medication were over. After I took my last pill, my skin remained clear and dry of excessive oil for a couple of months but gradually I began to develop a few small zits and my skin was becoming oily again. This was not the promise that my dermatologist gave me. He said I&#;d be acne free and at the very most I would be a small bump around the time of my menstruation. I can without a doubt tell you that is not my reality. 
It has now been almost  months since I completed my Accutane treatment and I am once again carrying around napkins to wipe the excessive oil from my face throughout the day. And there are days when I have several zits on my face at any given time. I don&#;t dare moisturize my already oily skin. But honestly speaking, my breakouts are not to the degree of what they used to be prior to Accutane because the pimples are smaller. But I&#;m unsure that if it&#;s too early to tell and that maybe with more time it may all go back to how it was originally. I guess time will tell.""",0,5

I believe Klonopin is unique among benzodiazepines - because it takes a while to &quot;kick in&quot; there is no calming rush after taking it.  The effects come on gradually, which in my opinion lessens the potential for abuse.  I have little to no sedation from taking Klonopin.""",2,2

Once it&#;s converted over, it turns into M aka o-deso (for short) which is - times more potent than Tramadol, where it&#;s real pain relief comes from. So People giving it  star? 
They are lacking proper metabolism OR they are taking a PD inhibitor (some antiacids, like tagament), grapefruit juice, among others.

I had tried almost everything from prescription creams neostrata proactive to minocycline amd doxycycline but none of it did anything and I had terrible reaction to alot of the creams and pills
I had been prescribed accutane years ago and read all the side effecst and threw it in the garbage but after talking to a couple doctors and trying almost everything I could think of I decided I would give it a shot. I had tried everything else and the reviews were pretty promising.

Was like have salt thrown on your wounds and having to wear a respirator was unbearable. Fortunately I had holidays for the next  days and being away from work made it easier. My job is very physical so already I wasn&#;t sure this would work. I noticed I started to get a bit depressed which I knew was a side effect but grew increasingly more concerned when  I read it can potentially be a permanent side effect even after discontinued use.  weeks in I started to get chest pain and it was bad it would come and go and that bothered the hell out of me the first time I didn&#;t worry about it but then it happened again and much worse. I became very concerned for my heart and stopped taking the pills all together. At that point I was only  weeks in and was just hoping I would be ok. After stopping I still had chest pain a few days off and on. Then the other pains started with my back and my feet. At this point I was at work and it was killing me. Especially my feet. They hurt so bad I wouldn&#;t leave the couch when I got home after work and I would just hurt to the point of tears. Painkillers did nothing for me which was highly unusual. I started to do some research about the foot pain and some of the reviews I came across scared the hell out of me. People that had taken accutane only a short few weeks like myself and been in pain constantly ever since. Others who had taken it and could no longer work or do anything. This became terrifying for me as I had not considered that  weeks of accutane  could possibly cause me horrid pain the rest of my life. With all the pain and fear I also became increasingly depressed. I spent a lot of time hating on myself and the reviews I read on they were equally terrifying. 
I was so scared that this was the worst thing I had ever done to myself.
Did I mention you absolutely should never drink on accutane. I was on holidays and had one drink and instantly regretted it. Was in bed the rest of the night
After a month of all this since I had stopped the pills the pain finally went away and I have never been so grateful. I hoped everyday that the constant pain would not be a permanent thing and fortunately I got very likely.
Also would like to add that none of my acne cleared up not that I was surprised. But I now no longer care. That was the stupidity thing I ever did in thinking that I would not be affected by the horrible side effects of accutane. No one thinks it will happen to them but obviously it happens to some people or they wouldn&#;t be listed as side effects and these bad reviews wouldn&#;t exist.

The other thing, and probably the more annoying side affect, is that is does impact my sleep.

) stop drinking coffee or other stimulants.

For example, I would worry about what I had to do after work while I was at work.  I would play future scenarios over and over before they even occurred. I would play past experiences over and over.  Some call this rumination.  Much of this has either dropped down to a manageable level or just disappeared with gabapentin. I have never been one much into pharmaceuticals but this one works for me.  I can see that some people love how it works for them, some people despise of it, and others say it doesn&#;t do a thing for them. We are all different and what works for one doesn&#;t work for another, just like diet.
I&#;m much happier going out and doing ordinary things like shopping, going to the bank, and other ordinary routine tasks.  I easily get bored with ordinary tasks and just want to get them done.  I just wanted to get things over with so that I could take on the next task. Now, I can be more with what I am doing without having to rush through it to get to the next goal. I take my time and stop to talk with people.  It&#;s ok if I&#;m late for the next task so long as it&#;s not an appointment where others are involved.  The main thing for me is to enjoy people when I go out to a store, or the bank, or wherever!  The gabapentin helps a part of my brain slow down so that I can &quot;see&quot; the people in my day.  
It really feels good to go to the gym and not feel tied to a specific exercise routine anymore. I like going in with a goal in mind, but allow for what the body is telling me.  Instead of just checking in at the desk, I&#;m more likely to spend time saying hello and having patience. So what if it means that I will get home  minutes later and eat dinner  minutes later, and then get  minutes less sleep. Big deal!  I see from writing this that gabapentin helps me to be less obsessive
With gabapentin, it is much easier for me to accept doing a job I am tired of. I&#;ve been at the same job for a long job and was getting antsy to move on. There isn&#;t anything bad about the job, but doing anything &quot;forever&quot; gets kind of old. Now, I know that soon I will be making a change, but can be&quot;more&quot; patient until the change happens. If I were completely patient, then the change would never happen. There is still fire to make the change happen. I feel less anxiety about change and welcome it more now. There are times in life when change is good.  I don&#;t feel as dead in my tracks with fearing change. It&#;s  o.k. if I don&#;t figure out &quot;everything&quot; today because there is always tomorrow!

I continued using Xanax for more restful sleep but after about  months I realized that short and long term memory was WAY down.   Stopped Xanax and replaced with GABA and this seems to be a far better solution.   The Wellbutrin worked great, felt more energy the first week but did take - weeks to fully kick in.

She was really small, and we almost had to take her off the medicine, but she eventually started gaining weight. She is still very small, but her weight is healthy. It does make her a bit more irritable, but it&#;s nothing compared to the rage she had before the medicine.

I usually take it during the weekdays and not take it on the weekends because I can go  to  hours without eating and barely having anything to drink because my appetite is not there.

I didn&#;t like the extended release (Ortho-McNeil brand name Ultram ER) as it seemed to hit too hard and then run out at like dinner time.  So I dose  times a day as the Tramadol seems to last about - hours.  The only downside I&#;ve had with Tramadol is an occasional short headache.

Taking Accutane was the best decision of my life. I feel like a different person and not only has it made my skin  times better but I am far more confident too.

I don&#;t think enough doctors stress the dependence factor of this medicine (it is very difficult to withdraw from, you need to decrease your dose very slowly over a long period of time), so educate yourself if it is prescribed to you and use the lowest effective dose.

I&#;m  and have been prescribed clonazopam for  years. Ive been in situations where my health insurance is in transition and I must go off the medication abruptly-- this is when I realized how deep I was. Weeks upon weeks of non stop physical, emotional, and psychological withdrawal effects that are like hell. Words cannot accurately describe just how awful it is. This, again, has been my experience during withdrawal as a long term clonazopam patient. 
All skin, especially the face, becomes numb. Vision gets fuzzy and difficult to see clearly. Panic attacks become extremely exasperated, frequent and debilitating. Severe irritability. Worst of all: a terrifying disconnection between your mind and body; as if you&#;re an onlooker watching and feeling this horrible thing happen to you, but not actually feeling connected to any of it-- that one is tough to explain. All of this... It can lasts months, maybe more. That&#;s right. Not just some one week hump to overcome. 
After finding how awful the withdrawal is I&#;ve been attempting to ween very very slowly down from  mg doses per day to eventually zero, hopefully. After six months of gradually decreases in dose I&#;m now at - mg doses per day and I&#;m not sure how or if I can go much less than that. No doctors I&#;ve had have been of any help. The ween down was my idea and the rate of it was also my idea based on experience. It sure would be nice to meet a doctor that truly had knowledge of this withdrawal syndrome and took it a bit more seriously. I am confident that the medication is no longer treating my anxiety disorder, but simply preventing withdrawal from the meds themselves. And there don&#;t seem to be any good alternatives. It&#;s a long road ahead, please think it over and over with someone knowledgeable before being so quick to embrace this miracle drug. The truth is that most of us actually need very real psychotherapy, not chemicals that run our lives.

I&#;m your typical  year old lad and have never written on a forum before but I want to write something for the people that are worried about taking this (in my opinion) miracle drug. I am coming to the end of my  month course and I can honestly say it&#;s been life changing. 

Before I started Roaccutane, I was fairly depressed and seriously lacking confidence due to my appearance. But after months of failed treatments on various antibiotics, I was referred to a dermatologist who instantly said there&#;s only one way to fix my acne problem, Roaccutane. At first I thought this is the worst case scenario and I&#;m going to be even more depressed as a result of the possible mental health side affects. Depression has run in my family so I was very worried. However, living like with acne wasn&#;t something I was prepared to do, so I started the course on mg a day.

The first week I had a headache daily, but thankfully these die off after a week and paracetamol and ibuprofen will take all the pain away. Almost immediately, my lips were cracking and from then on in, I never went anywhere without some Carmex lip balm in my pocket.

As the first  months went by, I was still breaking out and was starting to think it isn&#;t going to work. However, I&#;m so glad I stuck with it because now I haven&#;t got a single spot of my face and the scars have faded to the point where you can barely see them! After the third month, my derm upped my dose and I started to take mg a day. 

Luckily for me I hadn&#;t had any serious side affects. Just your occasional nose bleed and dry skin, and sometimes my eyes were a bit blurry but it&#;s not much of an issue.

Anyway, I just want anyone reading this that is worried about starting this medication, that not everyone has a horror story about Roaccutane and I couldn&#;t be happier at how it&#;s made me feel!!

Acutane is the nuclear option. It cuts off all moisture to your face, and your face basically presses the reset button and figures out that sending all that oil isn&#;t a good idea.
